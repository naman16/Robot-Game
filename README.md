The intent is for the robot to touch all bases while avoiding collisions with obstacles and the wall. If a robot bumps into something, it will stop moving and await input from the user to get out of its situation. If an obstacle collides with something, it will reverse in an arc for a fixed amount of time in an attempt to avoid the object. The user can change the speed and direction of the robot using the arrow keys. If the robot touches all bases, the user wins. If the robot runs out of lives, the user loses. To provide a chance for the player to escape when the robot collides with an obstacle, the robot is given momentary invincibility. Any collisions during the 2 second after a collision does not reduce the lives of the robot. It can still collide with obstacles (and will need to stop) but if the collision occurred during these invincibility frames, the number of lives will not decrease.
